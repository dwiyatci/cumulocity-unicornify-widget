:unicorn: A little esoteric Cumulocity widget that involves unicorns and high-dose of happiness.

### Why?
> You do understand that being afraid
of everything means you learn nothing.
There's no opportunity to discover,
to explore.

So this one is for opening a possibility to write a Cumulocity widget in TypeScript. 

*shameless rant: I myself am still in favour of JavaScript over TypeScript. I find the trade-off made between the syntax noise and the number of bugs reduced by using TypeScript is not that worth it. Types are good but TypeScript is *just* overrated.
